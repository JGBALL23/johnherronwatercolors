            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>It’s all about watercolor.
                I have tried acrylics, once attempted oils, never liked the feel of pastels, but find that gouache and ink are good playmates for watercolor.
               I refer to myself as an experimental artist. I seldom use a pencil, I sketch my paintings with brushes and other tools. More often than not I don’t know what I’m painting until I’m halfway there. In the first stage of a painting I work fast, loose, wet-in-wet and often wild. I look for shapes, accidents, and opportunities to build on in phase two. Once I spot a destination for the painting, I’m off and running.
               I may use a photo for reference but I won’t attempt to copy it, I’ll create my own interpretation. I find that copying photos, working tight, and struggling to match every little detail
               lacks the creative challenge I thrive on. I want to create something fresh, unique and stimulating to the eye. Watercolor, high quality paper, guts and luck make it possible.

            <h1>Watercolor Workshops</h1>
            <p>I love watercolor workshops. In France, Morocco, Ireland, Tubac and destinations to be discovered. What could be better than a vacation where you travel, eat and drink well, meet new watercolorists, learn, and paint every day. And return home with a couple of paintings you really like.
                I enjoy being a student and I really like conducting workshops. The watercolor exercises I created for my workshops are designed to take the “work” out of watercolor. People learn, loosen up, laugh and leave with some ideas they can put to work when they return home</p>
